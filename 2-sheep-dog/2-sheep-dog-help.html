            <h2> Challenge 2: Sheep Dog</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Once again, the goal here is to move in a way that makes <i>something else</i> move to the target.</br>
          This time it's a herd of sheep.</p>
          <p>Differently from a shopping cart, they have a mind on their own. They do move away from you, but in an impredictable manner.</br>
          Sometimes they even move completely on their own when you're far away!
          <p>
            - You can only move up, down, right, or left, one cell at a time.<br>
            - You can only move once per <i>update()</i><br>
            - Sheep will run away from you if you're closer than 2 cells away. The exact direction they pick tends to be "away from you", but it's randomised.<br>
            - Sheep have a 10% chance of moving randomly when youre further than 2 cells away.<br>
            - Once a sheep moves onto the target, it is removed from the board.<br>
            - The challenge is completed when there are no more sheep.<br>
            - Given the size of the board there is now the option to run the challenge at a faster speed.<br>
            - <i>state.U</i> is an object exposing a number of utility methods for doing mathematical operations on vectors. You won't necessarily need to use any of them, but a brief documentation can be accessed from the challenge page though the <i>Utils</i> link.
