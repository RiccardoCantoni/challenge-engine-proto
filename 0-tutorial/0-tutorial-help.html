            <h2> Challenge 0: Tutorial</h2>
          </div>
          <p>This is mostly to get everyone familiarized with the system. The simulated "world" is a 10x10 grid, with the origin on the bottom-left.
            The <i>state</i> contains two objects:</br> 
            - <i>target</i>, with an attribute <i>position</i></br>
            - <i>player</i>, also with a <i>position</i>, but also exposing a <i>move()</i> function.<br>
            All positions, coordinate, movements, etc.. are expressed as length 2 arrays.
          </p>
          <p>Get <i>player</i> to the <i>target.</i></p>
          <p>
            - You can only move up, down, right, or left, one cell at a time.<br>
            This means that the only allowed movements are [0,1], [0,-1]...<br>
            Attempting to move by an invalid vector will stop the simulation.<br>
            - You can only move once per <i>update()</i>. Attempting to move more than once will stop the simulation.<br>
            - The challenge is completed when <i>player</i> is in the same position as <i>target</i>.<br>
            <br>
            Some general considerations:<br>
            - The console works normally<br>
            - While the challenges definitely don't need any external code, importing 3rd-party libraries is not suggested, as 
            it will probably <i>break everything.</i><br>
            - Yes, this website uses <i>eval()</i> to read your code. This means that you can break it if you really try. It doesn't really cause any harm since there is no backend, so have fun.
