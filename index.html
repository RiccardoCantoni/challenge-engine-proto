            <h2> About this website:</h2>
          </div>
          <p>This website is a prototype, and it's still WIP.</p>
          <p>If it ever gets developed into a real thing it will be a place to host coding challenges for programmers.</p>
          <p>Unlike most corporate hackatons, <i>this is not a business case</i>. It's actually about programming.</p>
          <p>Unlike traditional hackatons this website relies on a homemade engine that supports a "game-like" graphical interface, in which 
            the effects of your code can be seen in real-time.</p>
          <p>The rules are simple:</br>
          - The language is Javascript. While you can write all the code you want, your task is to fill in the <i>update()</i> function.</br>
          - <i>update()</i> has one parameter, the <i>state</i>:
            an object containing everything you need to know about the simulated environment and all the actions that can be performed to affect it.</br>
          - <i>update()</i> will be called three times a second.</p>

          <p>This is mostly to get everyone familiarized with the system. The simulated "world" is a 10x10 grid, with the origin on the bottom-left.
            The <i>state</i> contains two objects:</br> 
            - <i>target</i>, with an attribute <i>position</i></br>
            - <i>player</i>, also with a <i>position</i>, but also exposing a <i>move()</i> function.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Get <i>player</i> to the <i>target.</i></p>
